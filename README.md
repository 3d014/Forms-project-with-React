# Forms-project-with-React
Forms project using React,Typescript and indexedDb

This is the same project as the project from the 'Forms-project-with-JS' repository. The goal of doing this project was to round up my React and Typescript knowledge.
It is also responsive unlike one with JS.
IndexedDb was used for storing data.
